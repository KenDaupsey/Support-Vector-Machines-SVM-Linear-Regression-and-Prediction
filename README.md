# Support-Vector-Machines-SVM-Linear-Regression-and-Prediction

This project demonstrates the implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for regression tasks, specifically for predicting continuous outcomes such as academic performance scores. SVM is a powerful machine learning technique that can effectively handle non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.

Project Description
The project involves loading a dataset containing information about students' academic performance, including reading, writing, math, and other relevant scores. It selects the desired features (reading and writing scores) and the target variable (math score), splits the data into training and testing sets, and then trains an SVM regression model. The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set, and the mean squared error is calculated to evaluate its performance. Additionally, the project showcases how to use the trained model for making predictions on a new data point.

Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

pandas
scikit-learn
You can install the required libraries using pip:


Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn
Usage
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script containing the code.
The script will load the dataset, select the desired features and target variable, split the data into training and testing sets, train the SVM regression model, make predictions on the test set, calculate the mean squared error, and demonstrate how to use the trained model for making predictions on a new data point.

Dataset
The project assumes that you have a dataset in the form of a pandas DataFrame with columns for reading, writing, math, social studies, and science scores. You will need to modify the code to match the structure of your dataset.
